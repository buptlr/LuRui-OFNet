# OFNet: Occlusion-shared and Feature-separated Network for Occlusion Relationship Reasoning

Created by Lu Rui.

### Introduction

Occlusion relationship reasoning of objects from monocular images are fundamental in computer vision and mobile robot applications. Furthermore, it can be used for scene understanding and perception, such as object detection, segmentation and 3D reconstruction. From the perspective of the observer, occlusion relationship reflects relative depth difference between objects in the scene.
